<b>IDEALISM</b> of Plato
</p><p>
This is the view that the only reality is the ideal world. A well known exponent of this view was Plato, a philosopher in ancient Greece (428-347 B.C.). Plato believed that the physical world around us is not real; 
it is constantly changing and thus you can never say what it really is. There is a world of ideas which is a world of unchanging and absolute truth. This is reality for Plato. Does such a world exist independent of 
human minds? Plato thought it did, and whenever we grasp an idea, or see something with our mind's eye, we are using our mind to conceive of something in the ideal world. There are a number of proofs of this ideal 
world. The concepts of geometry, such as the concept of a circle, which is a line equidistant from a point, is something which does not exist in the physical world. All physical circles, such as wheels, drawings, 
etc. are not perfectly round. Yet our mind has the concept of a perfect circle. Since this concept could not come from the physical world, it must come from an ideal world. Another proof is that from moral perfection. 
We can conceive of a morally perfect person, even though the people we know around us are not morally perfect. So where does someone get this idea of moral perfection? Since it could not have been obtained from the world 
around us, it must have come from an ideal world. Platonism has been an extremely influential philosophy down through the centuries.

Idealism is the metaphysical view that associates reality to ideas in the mind rather than to material objects.  It lays emphasis on the mental or spiritual components of experience, and renounces the notion of material 
existence.  Idealists regard the mind and spirit as the most essential, permanent aspects of one’s being.  The philosophical views of Berkeley, Christian Science, and Hinduism embrace idealist thought as they relate it to the 
existence of a supreme, divine reality that transcends basic human understanding and inherent sensory awareness.- Omonia Vinieris (2002)

The ideas of <b>Bishop Berkeley</b>

George Berkeley was an Anglican bishop from Scotland who challenged the irrationality of the notion that matter exists autonomously outside the mind as Locke and other contemporaneous empiricists speculated.  Berkeley’s 
immaterialist ontology maintained material substance cannot be real beyond the confines of the mind because inanimate objects do not have the ability to operate as causal agents.  It is nonsensical and foolish to designate the 
causal qualities of humans, or spirits, to inert matter.  Only life forces, such as spirits or souls, are able to function causally through perception and are the only substances that really exist.  Knowledge springs from 
perceptions, and because material objects are not causal agents, they unquestionably do not arouse perceptual activity.  Berkeley says that only an infinite being may produce and direct causally the perceptions that humans 
(spirits) have of physical matter.

</p><p>

“But whatever power I may have over my own thoughts, I find the ideas actually perceived by sense have not a like dependence on my will.  When in broad daylight I open my eyes, ‘tis not in my power to choose whether I see or 
no, or to determine what particular objects shall represent themselves to my view; and so likewise to the hearing and other senses, the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will.  There is therefore some other will 
or spirit that produces them,” (Principles).

</p><p>

Berkeley asserted that man’s ideas are emitted from the Divine, and thus all humans are merely ideas in the mind of God.  When he thinks of us, we are begotten and our existence activated.  Yet, God still remains ineffable as 
he is beyond our comprehension.  It is ultimately God who causes us to sense the physicality of objects by means of his direct volition.  First He will conceive the idea that we humans sense or perceive an object and then we 
actually do as He thought.  Hence, the effect of God’s mind on the mind of humans is required for sensation to occur.  Berkeley explicates that all physical objects are perceived via sensation.  Material objects are merely 
ideas obtained through perceptual activity and their attributes are sensible rather than being physical properties.  Sensation is therefore impossible without the presence of ideas or else anything sensed would be unperceived 
or unthought.  In conclusion, Berkeley asserts that all physical things in this world are ideas of the Divine and specifies this concept as esse est percipi, Latin for “to be is to be perceived.” Omonia Vinieris (2002)
